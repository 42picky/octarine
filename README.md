# octarine vscode extension

This extensions will prompt you to remove any other extensions that we found
as being broken and unmaintained.

We do expect that others will suggest new extensions to be added to the list
but we will ask them to provide a link or two for supporting their claim.

If you are an extension author please do not use this as an excuse for
boosting your extension in detriment or a "competing" one. Over years we
learnt that projects come and go as teaming up does not always work with
humans.

We do hope that this approach will make vscode a better place, especially as
Microsoft avoided investing in improvement of the user experience of
the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), assuming that more
is better. In that area we do think that **less, is more**. Less junk, more
productivity.

**Enjoy!**
